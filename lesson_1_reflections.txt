How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It pinpointed the differences and it was a shorter list of lines where the error could be.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Well it could speed up the process of finding bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

PRO: flexibility, logic to commits;
CONS: errors, not saving enough

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because they're meant to do different things.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives the ids for all the commits. with git diff you can see the changes between files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Well it is easier to keep track of everything. It is easier to find back and it is really easy to get to a previous version



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use it in my everyday developing tasks.
