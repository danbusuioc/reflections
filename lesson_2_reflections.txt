What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A whole bunch of hidden files appear to know that this is a git repository, and to have git track what happens inside.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is in between the two of them. It is a place of transit between working files and repository. It can help you avoid mistakes before commiting.
