When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are workin with other people, or working from different places.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It could be useful to do it manually because someone else could modify your repository and you do not want those modifications.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is copying a repository on your computer, or from your own project. Forking is like cloning directly on github. Branches are a way to get away from the current path in the repository and do something else, keeping what is behind.
I would use clone when I need a fresh copy of the repository on my computer. Fork when wanting to clone another project and give atribution. I would use branch when making new features
